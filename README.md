# Hang in There  

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?) This project I created a website that generates random motivational posters and the user can save combinations, toggle between different motivational posters, create your own motivational posters, & even browse unmotivational posters. You can save various posters to be revisited in the saved poster page, and also browse unmotivational posters on the unmotivational poster page. If you find an unmotivational poster you do not like, you can double click a poster and delete it from the grid.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?) 

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off. gifs preferred!)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?) This is the first project in Module 2 of the Turing program. This was a solo project and my first introduction to JavaScript, HTML, & CSS. It took about 9 days to complete all functionality and clean up/refactor my code. 

### Contributors:
[//]: <> (Who worked on this application? Link to your GitHub. Consider also providing LinkedIn link) Andrew Snyder is the sole contributor, my cohort also assisted with problem solving and refactoring solutions. 

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?) The learning goals of this project were to get experience writing JavaScript, HTML, & CSS to create a website. Gain more experience with front end development and begin to gain skills writing in Javascript.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?) Some wins include gaining more confidence with iteration using JavaScript. Writing JS was very new to me and now I feel very comfortable working with this language. I now have a better understanding of how HTML, CSS, & JS interact with one another and feel in the future I would be much more confident building something from scratch. I can better read JS and I hope to continue to add skills to my toolkit. Some challenges were fully understanding how JS syntax functions with event listeners and how functions are called. I ran into some issues when trying to attach functions to my event listeners and why the syntax needs to be set up in a specific way. Functions without names are challenging for me to wrap my head around, but I think I have gained more understanding as the project progressed. It was satisfying to see my project come together and my website functioning the way I intended.
